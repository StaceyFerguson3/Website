            <h2>Is having a doula right for you?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Are you interested in having a doula with you during any or all stages of pregnancy, birthing and post-partum? A doula can have a positive impact as a support for you during one of the most important times in your life.
            
                As your doula, I am there to take care of the non-medical aspects of your experience. My role is to provide support for your whole family circle and ensure your loved ones are included in your care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of our traditional ceremonies and birth practices are coming back. I am here to support how <em>you</em> want your culture and ceremony incorporated. Talk to your elders. Both women and men had/have roles throughout the circle so be sure to ask everyone! </p>

            <h2>A Bit About Me And My Doula Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Stacey Ferguson. I am Coast Salish from qayqayt First Nation. I am also Chinese and Scottish. While I had been present for births in the past, supporting family or friends, I didn't really consider myself a doula. This is what we did in our family. When I gave birth to my daughter, my entire family was there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When early 2020 rolled around my daughter announced she was pregnant with my first grandchild we fully expected I would be with her, every step of the way. We know what happened in 2020. Suddenly, our traditional ways were not allowed in hospitals. The only way I would be permitted to enter the hospital and support my daughter and her husband would be if I attended and received certification from a colonially recognized institution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did what any ridiculous mom  would do. I went to school and received certification through Doula Canada two months before my daughter gave birth.  I enjoyed birth work and wanted to learn more of our traditional teachings.

            <h2>Can you afford a doula?</h2>
                <p>
                    With this resource, you can afford a doula. Please look at this resource. Funding is available for Indigenous families through the 
                    <a href="https://bcaafc.com/dafgp/"target=_blank">Doulas for Aboriginal Family Grant Program</a>. The goal of the program is to increase healthy birth outcomes for Indigenous families by removing the cost barrier to accessing doula services. They also provide a listing of available doulas who are part of the program.
                </p>
                <p>
