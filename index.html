                    Are you interested in having a doula with you during any or all stages of pregnancy, birthing and post-partum? A doula can have a positive impact as a support for you during one of the most important times in your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As your doula, I am there to take care of the non-medical aspects of your experience. My role is to provide support for your whole family circle and ensure your loved ones are included in your care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of our traditional ceremonies and birth practices are coming back. I am here to support how <em>you</em> want your culture and ceremony incorporated. If you're uncertain, talk to your elders if at all possible. Both women and men had/have roles throughout the circle so be sure to ask everyone!

        <h2>Can you afford a doula?</h2>
        <p>
            With this resource, you can afford a doula! Funding is available for Indigenous families through the 
            <a href="https://bcaafc.com/dafgp/"target=_blank">Doulas for Aboriginal Family Grant Program</a>. The goal of the program is to increase healthy birth outcomes for Indigenous families by removing the cost barrier to accessing doula services. They also provide a listing of available doulas who are part of the program.
